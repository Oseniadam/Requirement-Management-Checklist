  # Requirements Management Checklist
  
  **Requirements Management Plan, Requirements Gathering Template** and **Traceability Matrix** is related to the 
  **Scope Management Plan** created with inputs from the **Project Charter**, **development approach** and **Quality Management Plan**. 

It forms part of the **Project Management Plan** and aligns with **change management, scope management**, the **release** and **iteration plan, development approach** and the **requirements backlog**. 

The completed plan drives the Requirements **log and Traceability Matrix**, and is and input to the **Risk Register and Quality Management Plan**.
